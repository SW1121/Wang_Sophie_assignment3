        <h2>My CAT 🐈</h2>
          <h3>Lion King - Simba！！！</h3>
          <h3>About him</h3>
        <p>Simba is the first kitten I ever adopted. I met him in a pet store in August 2022, and he captured my heart with his adorable and intelligent nature. I named him Simba because I thought the name exudes a royal vibe, haha! Also, I've always been a fan of The Lion King movie from my childhood. Simba enjoys eating canned meat, and he loves playing games with us. If you ignore him or forget to feed him his favorite canned food, he gets upset and expresses his emotions by loudly meowing, stomping his feet on the ground, and running around the house in protest.</p>
